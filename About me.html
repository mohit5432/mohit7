Over the last decade, natural areas in the West–including forests, wetlands, deserts, and grasslands– have been lost to development at the rate of one football field every two and a half minutes. These remaining habitats are becoming smaller and increasingly fragmented (by roadways, development, and other human activity), making it more difficult or impossible for wildlife to access necessary resources.

The diminished availability of suitable habitat has placed more than 300 California animal species at or near the brink of extinction, with many other western wildlife species also in severe decline. Sonoma County – located north of San Francisco – is known for its lush landscapes, yet it is accruing habitat loss 20% faster than other California counties and 80% faster than elsewhere in the US.

Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. 
It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; however, 
nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.

<br></br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
 remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
